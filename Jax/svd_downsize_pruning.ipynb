        "## Overview of Singular Value Decomposition\n",
        "\n",
        "In this takehome, you will be working on a problem involving singular value decomposition. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) exists for every rectangular matrix. The nice thing about SVD is that the original matrix can be expressed as the sum of outer products of left and singular vectors scaled by the corresponding singular values. Formally:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Let ùõ¢ be a rectangular matrix of dimensions ùëöùòπùëõ, then the SVD of the matrix A is given by $ A = Uùõ¥V^T$ where $U$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape mxm containing the left singular vectors, $V$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape nxn containing the right singular vectors and $ùõ¥$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$. This formulation of SVD can be re-expressed as \\begin{align} A = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} s_i. u_i v_i^T \\end{align} where $r = \\text{min}(m,n)$ represents the rank of the matrix, $s_i$ is the $i$th singular value and $u_i v_i^T$ is the outer product of the $i$th left and right singular vectors. \n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- \\begin{align}\n",
        "A = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\text{min}(m,n)} s_i. u_i v_i^T\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\\begin{align} -->\n",
        "\n",
        "> The singular values $ùõ¥$ are decreasing in order. So, each outer product is scaled by a smaller value as we compute each term in the sum above. This gives us an opportunity to approximate $A$ using only the sum of the first $k$ outer products where $k < \\text{min}(m,n)$ $-$ this effectively means that we are zero-ing out some of the singular values by assuming that the contribution to the sum is negligible. This is called low-rank approximation.\n",

A third application of low rank approximations would be **matrix completion** when our row-wise and column-wise correlated matrix is sparse and we want to fill gaps for some similarity based applications (e.g. large matrices for recomender systems seem to be most beloved example of this).\n"

Compared to other compression methods used for deep neural networks such as pruning, quantization, or efficient architectures, what are the relative merits/demerits of low rank approximations?

        "This question allows to go very fahr/deep in the literature and in choosing the comparison criteria. Here I try to focus only on just a general notion of needed space (without specifying for GPU, CPU, TPU etc.), on general notion of latency (inference mainly) on methods generaly (not on their diverse types) on example of ConvNets.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Among **pruning, quantization, low rank approximation**, the latest is most prone to **accuracy drop with increasing compression rate**, while there is no clear winner between pruning, quantization. In some architectures prunning winns (e.g. vgg) in others quantization performes better (e.g. ResNet). [Here](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/papers/ijcnn21c.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09671.pdf) are actual comparisons under comparable settings for nn performance of different compressed architectures. \n",
        "2. On the other hand **prunning** requires much longer training time (needs several iterations between prunning and retraining/or tunning) and \n",
        "3. **quantization** can be extremely trickty to actually implement (as an optimal implementation can be extremely hardware dependent and also quantization of just pretrained weights is not all we want - we want quantization of operators as well and unseen inputs and potential bit overflows may be a problem). \n",
