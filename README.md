## General machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning projects in notebooks

    ♾️ in development

    The goal of these notebooks is to provide me and other lifelong learners with google colab implementations to stop low-end hardware from being a barrier to our curiosity. An essential part of these notebooks uses, combines, or reimplements other people's work I learned from, so feel free to use the code as you like without mentioning me, but do not forget to reference others. Good luck!

    P.S.

    Please note that files here are mostly created in google colab. Therefore if you use them outside google colab, you may need to adjust the file paths, or you may need to install some packages that are directly imported and used here.
